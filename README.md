# Reservoir-autoencoder
Reservoir computer followed by an autoencoder for prediction of chaotic temporal signals


The reservoir works well in the prediction of chaotic signals. The reservoir projects the signal into a high dimensional state. The autoencoder then creates a low dimensional representation of the reservoir state, removing noise. The middle layer of the autoencoder is then trained to predict the next step of the chaotic temporal signal
